"All good"
The interpreterv1.py file contains a complete interpeter (according to this first projects spec) for the Brewin v1 language built in python.
There are no known bugs and it is ready to build upon for future projects. A design choice suggested by my TA was a separate function class
that stores each function's name and statements, and in the future its arguments and return values.
